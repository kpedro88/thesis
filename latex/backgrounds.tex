\section{Background Estimations
\label{sec:background}}

Several SM processes can mimic the final-state signatures expected from leptoquark or top squark pair production and decay. In this dissertation, the backgrounds are divided into three groups, which are denoted as \ttbar irreducible, major reducible, and other. The \ttbar irreducible background comes from the pair production of top quarks when both the light lepton and \tauh are genuine, each produced from the decay of a \W boson. In this case, the light lepton can originate either directly from the \W boson decay or from a decay chain $\W \rightarrow \tau  \cPgn_{\tau} \rightarrow \ell\cPgn_{\ell} \cPgn_{\tau} \cPgn_{\tau}$. The major reducible background consists of events in which a quark or gluon jet is
misidentified as a \tauh. The processes contributing to the major reducible background are \W + jets, \Z + jets, and \ttbar. Additionally, a small contribution from the QCD multijet process is included, in which both the light lepton and the \tauh are misidentified jets. The contribution from QCD is only significant in the \etau channel of the leptoquark search. The third group, other backgrounds, consists of processes that make small contributions and may contain either genuine or misidentified tau leptons. The other backgrounds are estimated using the MC simulation, while the \ttbar irreducible and major reducible backgrounds are estimated using observed data. Both the major reducible and other backgrounds include events with both genuine and misidentified light leptons.

%This includes the diboson and single-top-quark processes, the \ttbar and \Z+jets processes when a light lepton is misidentified as a \tauh, and the \Z+jets process when the Z boson decays to a pair of tau leptons.
